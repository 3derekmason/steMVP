### HRDEN15 MVP Project

---

A stem lab activity app for ECE teachers.

A group of activities will be pre-loaded into a postgreSQL database. The user will be able to display all activities or a single random activity. There will also be the option to add a new activity (with database persistence) and if time allows, an option to edit/remove existing activities.
